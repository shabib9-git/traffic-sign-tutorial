# Deep Learning Approaches

## CNN-based classifiers (overview)
- Convolutions learn features automatically.
- Typically classify cropped/sign ROIs.

## Lightweight CNNs for mobile
- Examples: MobileNet variants, YOLO-tiny family.

- Good for **real-time** on-device inference.

## Transformer-based methods
- Attention helps with **small/occluded** signs.
- Example: Pyramid Transformer (feature fusion with attention).
