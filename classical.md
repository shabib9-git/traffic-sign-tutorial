# Classical Detection Methods

## Color-based approaches
- Threshold red/yellow to isolate candidate regions [<a href="bibliography.md">Romić et al. 2023</a>]

## Shape-based approaches
- Standardized shapes (circle, triangle, octagon)  
- Hough transform and contour analysis for detection [<a href="bibliography.md">Romić et al. 2023</a>]

## Hand-crafted features
- Histogram of Oriented Gradients (HOG) captures edges  
- SVM classifiers for recognition [<a href="bibliography.md">Romić et al. 2023</a>]  
- Historical context of benchmarks: [<a href="bibliography.md">Stallkamp et al. 2011</a>]
