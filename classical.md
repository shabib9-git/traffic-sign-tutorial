# Classical Detection Methods

## Color-based approaches
- Threshold red/yellow to isolate candidate regions  
- Morphological operations to clean masks

## Shape-based approaches
- Standardized shapes (circle, triangle, octagon)  
- Hough transform and contour analysis for detection

## Hand-crafted features
- Histogram of Oriented Gradients (HOG) captures edges  
- SVM classifiers for recognition
