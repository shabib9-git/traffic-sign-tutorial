# Successes and Failures

## Where it works well
- Clear daylight, frontal view, clean signage.
- Benchmarks show high accuracy on curated datasets.

## Common failure cases
- **Small or distant** signs (few pixels tall).
- **Occlusion** (trees, vehicles), **weather/night**, **faded paint**.
- **Domain shift** (different countries/sign styles).

**TODOs**
- Add 1â€“2 side-by-side images: detected vs. missed.
- Short audio reflection on failure cases.
