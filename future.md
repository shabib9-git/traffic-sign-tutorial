# Future Directions

Looking ahead, research in traffic sign recognition is moving toward lightweight and quantized models that can run efficiently on mobile and embedded devices.  
Transformer-based methods are becoming more common, offering improved accuracy for small or partially hidden signs.  
Another promising direction is accessibility, where recognition systems are combined with audio or haptic feedback to help people with low vision.  
These advances bring the technology closer to reliable, real-world use.
