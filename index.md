# Traffic Sign Detection & Classification

Welcome! This tutorial introduces **traffic sign detection and classification** for beginners in Computer Vision.  
Use the top links to navigate through short pages with pictures, audio notes, and references.

## Why this matters
- Road safety (driver-assist & autonomous driving)
- Accessibility (assistive apps for low-vision users)

> Tip: Each page has a short audio note. Add your own recording in `assets/audio/` and link it.

**TODOs for you**
- Add a banner image of traffic signs to `assets/images/` and reference it here.
- Record a 60â€“90 sec intro MP3: `assets/audio/intro.mp3` and link with the audio tag below.

<!-- Example audio embed (replace the src after you add your file) -->
<audio controls src="assets/audio/intro.mp3">Your browser does not support audio.</audio>
