# Traffic Sign Detection & Classification

## Why this matters
- Critical for road safety  
  - Self-driving cars must detect and respond to signs  
- Accessibility for low-vision users  
  - Mobile apps can provide audio or haptic feedback  

## What this tutorial covers
- Classical methods (color, shape, HOG+SVM)  
- Deep learning (CNNs, YOLO-tiny, Transformers)  
- Benchmark datasets and metrics  
- Successes and failures  
- Key challenges  
- Future directions in research and accessibility
