# Traffic Sign Detection & Classification

Welcome to this tutorial on traffic sign detection and classification.  

Traffic signs are essential for road safety, and being able to automatically detect and recognize them is important for both autonomous vehicles and assistive technologies for people with low vision.  

In this tutorial, we’ll explore classical computer vision approaches such as color and shape detection, and then move on to deep learning methods including CNNs, YOLO, and transformers.  
We’ll also discuss datasets, evaluation metrics, successes and failures, challenges, and future directions in this field.
